The model training is done in two stages. Perform first stage training and then perform second stage training. 

The folder First_Stage contains the file: first_stage_train.py which should be used for the first stage model training. After model training, the model will be saved in the same folder.

The folder Second_Stage contains the file: second_stage_train.py which should be used for the second stage model training. Before running this file, copy paste all the model files saved in the First_Stage folder back into this folder. After second stage model training, the model will be saved in the same folder.

The folder Test contains the file: test.py which should be used for the test case inference. Before running this file, copy paste both first and second stage model files saved in the Second_Stage folder back into this folder.
